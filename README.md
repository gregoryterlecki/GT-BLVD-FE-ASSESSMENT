# Intro

Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to the Boulevard frontend engineer take-home assessment!

Weâ€™re so glad you decided to engage in our recruiting process and designed this assessment to be fun, flexible, and let you strut your stuff.

This assessment is purposefully open-ended. We want to see your style â€“ everything from setting up your favorite tools to how you document your code.

We recommend seeing how far you can get in 4 hours.

Soâ€¦ letâ€™s jump in!

## The project

Youâ€™re going to build an _email verification_ web app that mimics the type of stuff we build at Boulevard!

### Here are the requirements:

- Use this repository as a starting point - it is based off of [Create React App](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/material-ui-vite-ts)
- Create a form that lets a user enter an email address
- Consume the [DISIFY email verification API](https://www.disify.com/) to find out whether the email address is valid or disposable and expose that information to the user
- Track the history of validation requests that have been made by the user and show that on the page

### Hereâ€™s how we will evaluate:

- The application is feature complete and bug free - we value attention to detail and care about the quality of our work.
- You added linting and style controls - we care about consistent styles and engineered controls to enforce them.
- You added tests - we care about the quality of our code and put controls in place to ensure quality now and in the future.
- You used external libraries where appropriate - we donâ€™t want to reinvent the wheel and would rather spend our time investing in what truly adds value to our customers. Consider component libraries, network libraries, state libraries, etc.
- You used clean code principles and component composition - we prioritize clean code to enhance readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- You used TypeScript to help achieve clean code - we use Typescript to enhance readability, maintainability, and code safety.
- You added accessibility controls - our mission is to make self care accessible to ALL. This includes things like supporting screen readers and keyboard form navigation
- You commit your work in small, atomic commits - we practice continuous integration and deployment through small, incrementally deliverable units of work 

### Running the app

You will need to use NodeJS version 16.14.2 or greater.
[https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.14.2/](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.14.2/)

*Install*
```
> npm install
```

*Running the app*
```
> npm start
```

# GREG's NOTES

Thanks for taking the time to review my submission for the take home assessment.

While the app works, there is a lot more I aimed to get done with this project.
The requirements were quite simple, and for all of them I knew exactly how I would get it done and which tools I would use.

However, there were things I got stuck with that took a lot of time. On top of that, I had nobody to ask in case I got stuck with something.
For that reason, I don't feel this submission is a true reflection of my work in the real world.

In either case, here's a breakdown of what I was able to accomplish, what I struggled with, and why:

## What I got done

- The application is feature complete and bug free.
- I was able to ensure the application's accessibility by doing the following:
  - Test the ui for keyboard-only navigation. Data can be entered and submitted without a mouse.
  - I changed the default document title to something relevant to the page, making the app work much better with screen readers.
  - I made sure to use semantic HTML.
- I was able to write tests for each component (not as many as I'd like).
- I was able to split my work into many smaller PRs.
- Add i18n integration to avoid using hard coded text in the markup.
- Error handling in case of a failure of the email validation service.

## What I didn't get done

- integrate style and formatting controls
- refactoring code
- clean up the FE layout; in this project, the UI is quite bare
- responsive design
- formatting the default `Date().toString()` to something more readable

## My Process / Why I didn't get everything done that I wanted to

For most of these, I simply didn't have enough time. 

Setting up tests for components was surprisingly difficult, although simple in concept. While I worked with all kinds of automated testing before, setting it up for the first time is simply something I (or any developer for that matter) don't do nearly as often as writing new tests.
Getting this set up is one thing that held me up for a bit of time.

As for enforcing code formatting controls, I wanted to use husky to make it easier to write a pre-commit hook. After following their set up guide, I found my pre-commit hooks were simply not running, despite having followed a lot of the troubleshooting advice from husky's docs.
I spent a lot of time trying to get this working, since I _really_ wanted to get a pre commit hook working that would run prettier and eslint.

During this process I even tried ditching husky in case using a default pre-commit hook might be easier.
However I ran into a (small) roadblock with this as well. While I was able to get the hook to run tests for example, by default the test runner doesn't simply output the results of the test. It runs in watch mode. I couldn't just disable watch mode altogether though. I tried adding ` --watchAll=false` to the test script in `package.json`, but I was having trouble with that as well.

Anyways, point is, this stuff isn't supposed to be hard and I knew right away this is what I would do for formatting enforcement, since I've worked with this in the past.

I also would have liked to extract a lot of the logic and state in `App.tsx`, but I realized that maybe I don't need to.
Firstly, the component itself is still well under 100 lines long, and it felt like overkill to bring in a provider, or a state management tool for this.
Additionally, although I absolutely believe in avoiding prop-drilled code, in this case state was only being passed 1 level down, so I didn't deem these solutions necessary.

I also wanted to make my last PR smaller, but didn't have enough time to break this apart.
All the component tests should pass from this branch, although I wasn't able to verify the tests in the EntryTable and EntryForm branches.

## Summary

This was very fun to do. Thanks for giving me the opportunity.
This code is definitely not what I'd submit in the real world, but I hope that the details I've written above can better attest to my attention to detail as an engineer overall.

Thank you so much, and I can't wait to hear back.
